Un120
===============
Browser extension for blocking perpetrator glorifying news content reporting on mass homicide events.

FAQ
------
**What is perpetrator glorifying?**  
If an editorial reporting on a mass homicide event focuses primarily or exclusively on the name, background, looks, motives etc. of the perpetrator(s), with little to no content on the victims or the community impact, it is classified as "perpetrator glorifying".

**How will Un120 work?**  
Current plan is allowing multiple levels with a 'by article' being most lenient and 'by publication' being the least with potential levels like 'by author' in between. A community reporting system is also planned.
